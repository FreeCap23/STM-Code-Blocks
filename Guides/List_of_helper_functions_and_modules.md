# List of helper functions and modules
This is a list of all the helper functions and modules. The header files (`.h`) contain the declarations of the functions and the source files (`.c`) contain the definitions. The header files are only in **Core/Inc** and the source files are only in **Core/Src**. You will likely only need to look at the header file documentation.

- flash_helper_h7a3.h contains `Flash_Write()`, `Flash_Read()` and `Flash_Erase()`
- pwm_helper.h contains `analogWrite()` and `analogWritePercent()`
- serial_print.h contains `SerialPrint()` and `SerialPrintLn()`
