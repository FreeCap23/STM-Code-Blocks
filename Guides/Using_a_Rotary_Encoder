# Using a Rotary Encoder
This guide will show you how to use a rotary encoder with CLK, DT and SW pins.

## Pin configuration
For this example, I've connected **DT to PC2**, **CLK to PC13** and **SW to PD4**. At first I connected them in order, PC15-PC13 but I was having problems with that configuration. Use these pins instead.
- SW is set as GPIO_EXTI (External interrupt) with **Pull-up** and **falling edge** trigger detection.
- DT is set as GPIO_Input
- CLK is set as GPIO_EXTI with **Rising and Falling edge** trigger dection.
