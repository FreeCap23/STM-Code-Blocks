# 10.Send Serial Data Module

This file will only cover sending serial data with the functions in `serial_print.h`. Receiving serial data isn't covered here. See `02.Device_Configuration.md`, UART section for receiving.

## What You Can Do With It

These functions allow you to send formatted debug or status messages from your STM32 microcontroller over a UART interface (such as a USB-to-Serial connection).

* `SerialPrint()` behaves like `printf`, sending formatted text.
* `SerialPrintLn()` does the same, but automatically appends `\r\n` (carriage return and line feed).

**Use cases include:**

* Debugging firmware via serial terminal (e.g., PuTTY).
* Displaying sensor values, status messages, or errors.
* Logging data for analysis.

## How to Install It
Just copy `serial_print.h` and `serial_print.c` to your project's `Inc` and `Src` folders respectively
***Copy from where."

## How to Configure It
https://wiki.st.com/stm32mcu/wiki/Getting_started_with_UART

See serial_print.h for functions for easily printing information (text, integers, or any other data type) through UART with the same syntax as `printf()` from the C `stdio.h` library.

> ℹ️ Some boards (Like the F411E Discovery) do not support VCP (Virtual COM Port), meaning you cannot use the ST-Link USB port as a serial communication port. If that is the case, you need to use the RX/TX pins themselves and use a USB to Serial converter to talk to the PC.

> ⚠️ Setting baud rate too high may result in lost bytes when receiving data in bulk without DMA

## How to Use It

### a. Basic Usage:

```c
SerialPrint(&huart2, "Temperature: %d C", temperature);
SerialPrintLn(&huart2, "System started.");
```

### b. Output:

If connected via USB-to-Serial and monitored with a terminal, you will see:

```
Temperature: 25 C
System started.
```

### c. Notes:
* See `printf`'s documentation for a full table of format specifiers [here](https://cplusplus.com/reference/cstdio/printf/).
