# 06. LCD Drivers.md
There's two ways to use an LCD: In parallel mode, or with an I<sup>2</sup>C module.

# I2C
## A. What you can do with it
Allows you to display text, numbers and special characters on alphanumeric LCDs displays through an I2C connection. It supports displays with sizes **16x2, 16x4, 20x2, 20x4**.

This module is based on this library: https://github.com/alixahedi/I2C-LCD-STM32.

## B. How to Install It
For installation instructions, [see the README.md](https://github.com/alixahedi/I2C-LCD-STM32?tab=readme-ov-file#installation).

***Alternative explanation:***
- go to https://github.com/alixahedi/I2C-LCD-STM32?tab=readme-ov-file#installation
- click on the green "<>Code" button
- click on the "Download Zip" button to download the library files
- open the library archive and put the .h and .c files into your project as follows:
-            "i2c_lcd.h" file in YourProjectName / Core / Inc
-            "i2c_lcd.c" file in YourProjectName / Core / Src 


## C. How to Configure It

Before using the LCD functions, you must configure the `I2C_LCD_HandleTypeDef` structure with the appropriate I²C handle and LCD address.

### 1. Configure I²C Peripheral

Ensure I²C is initialized using STM32CubeMX or manually in your code:

```c
I2C_HandleTypeDef hi2c1;  // This should match your CubeMX configuration
```
***I STOPPED HERE becasue I don't see any instructions about the CubeMX configuration.***

### 2. Define and Initialize the LCD Handle

***Where you guide me to put those piece of code?***
***Suggestion: use the following workflow: take THIS piece-of-code or file and place it HERE (if necessary, modify it in THIS way)***

```c
/* USER CODE BEGIN Includes *
#include "i2c_lcd.h"
/* USER CODE END Includes */

/* USER CODE BEGIN PV */
I2C_LCD_HandleTypeDef lcd;
/* USER CODE END PV */

/* USER CODE BEGIN 2 */
lcd.hi2c = &hi2c1;     // I2C peripheral used (e.g., I2C1)
lcd.address = 0x4E;    // I²C address of your LCD (usually 0x4E or 0x27, see below how to find it if not)
/* USER CODE END 2 */
```

* **`hi2c`**: Pointer to the `I2C_HandleTypeDef` of your configured I²C peripheral
* **`address`**: I²C address of the LCD (left-shifted 7-bit address, e.g., `0x27 << 1 = 0x4E`)

---

## D. How to Use It 
For a full list of functions, see `i2c_lcd.h`

***I don't want to go somewhere else to find basic info. I want to find it here, formulated in simple terms.***
***In this chapte, by basic info mean what steps I need to follow / what function I need to use to :***
- ***clear the display***;
- ***set the display cursor position***;
- ***display a text***;
- ***display an INTEGER number***;
- ***display an FLOAT number***

## Displaying a formatted string
In order to display a formatted string, we first need to build the string in a buffer:
```c
char buffer[80];
// This function takes your format string "Pi: %.3f" and stores the resulting
// string in the buffer
sprintf(buffer, "Pi: %.3f", 3.1415926535);
lcd_puts(&hlcd, buffer);
```
This will display `Pi: 3.142`. Note how the number was automatically rounded. For more format specifiers, see [the Parameters section of the printf documentation](https://cplusplus.com/reference/cstdio/printf/).

***Put the above code behing specific functions (each made for a single purpose mentioned at point D).***

## Example usage
This example works on any size display, but it will only look right on a 20x4
```c
/* USER CODE BEGIN 2 */
hlcd.hi2c = &hi2c1;
hlcd.address = 78;
lcd_init(&hlcd);
lcd_clear(&hlcd);
lcd_puts(&hlcd, "Hello there");

lcd_gotoxy(&hlcd, 0, 1);
sprintf(buffer, "Float (%%.3f): %.3f", 3.1415926535);
lcd_puts(&hlcd, buffer);

/* USER CODE END 2 */

/* Infinite loop */
/* USER CODE BEGIN WHILE */
while (1)
{
  sprintf(buffer, "Tick: %lu", HAL_GetTick());
  lcd_gotoxy(&hlcd, 0, 2);
  lcd_puts(&hlcd, buffer);
  /* USER CODE END WHILE */

  /* USER CODE BEGIN 3 */
}
/* USER CODE END 3 */
```
***publish the configuration content only in the configuration chapter***


## How do I find the address??
First, try addresses `0x20`, `0x27` and `0x4E`. If those don't work, try running this snippet of code:

```c
// main.c

/* ----- >8 snip ----- */
/* USER CODE BEGIN PV */
I2C_LCD_HandleTypeDef hlcd;
/* USER CODE END PV */
/* ----- >8 snip ----- */

/* ----- >8 snip ----- */
/* USER CODE BEGIN 2 */
hlcd.hi2c = &hi2c1; // Change this to your i2c handle
char buffer[64];
for (int8_t address = 0; address < 128; address++) {
  // Convert the address to a string in hex format
  sprintf(buffer, "Address: %#X", address-1);
  hlcd.address = address;
  lcd_init(&hlcd);
  lcd_clear(&hlcd);
  lcd_puts(&hlcd, buffer);
}
/* ----- >8 snip ----- */
```
You should see the address printed on your display.

# Parallel

## A. What you can do with it
Allows you to display text, numbers and special characters on alphanumeric LCDs. It supports displays with sizes **16x2, 16x4, 20x2, 20x4** and communication with **4 pins** and **8 pins**.

## B. How to install it
Download `LiquidCrystal.h` and `LiquidCrystal.c` from here https://github.com/FreeCap23/STM32LiquidCrystal and place them in `Core/Inc` and `Core/Src` respectively.

## C. How to configure it
### Peripheral configuration
Connect pins **RS, RW, E, D0-D7** to your STM32 board, set them as **Outputs** and optionally add Labels.

In the following examples I will use 8 bit mode, so I will have 8 Data pins defined and labeled in CubeMX along the RS, RW, E pin labels.

### Code configuration
In `LiquidCrystal.h`, change `EIGHT_BIT_MODE` according to how many pins you want to use (4 or 8) like so:
```c
// 1 = Eight bit, 0 = Four bit
#define EIGHT_BIT_MODE 1
```

## D. How to use it
in `main.c`:

### Include the driver
```c
/* USER CODE BEGIN Includes */
#include "LiquidCrystal.h"
/* USER CODE END Includes */
```

### Initialise the display and print something
```c
/* USER CODE BEGIN 2 */
// If you're using the display in 4 bit mode, then you can replace
// LCD_D0..D3_GPIO_Port and _Pin with 0s
LiquidCrystal(
    LCD_RS_GPIO_Port, LCD_RS_Pin,
    LCD_RW_GPIO_Port, LCD_RW_Pin,
    LCD_E_GPIO_Port, LCD_E_Pin,
    LCD_D0_GPIO_Port, LCD_D0_Pin,
    LCD_D1_GPIO_Port, LCD_D1_Pin,
    LCD_D2_GPIO_Port, LCD_D2_Pin,
    LCD_D3_GPIO_Port, LCD_D3_Pin,
    LCD_D4_GPIO_Port, LCD_D4_Pin,
    LCD_D5_GPIO_Port, LCD_D5_Pin,
    LCD_D6_GPIO_Port, LCD_D6_Pin,
    LCD_D7_GPIO_Port, LCD_D7_Pin,
    4, 16
);
print("Hello world!");
/* USER CODE END 2 */
```

### Printing a formatted string
Before calling the `print()` function, we first need to generate the formatted string using `sprintf()` from the `stdio.h` library.
```c
char buffer[32];
sprintf(buffer, "Temp: %.2f C", temperature);
print(buffer);
```
This will print, for example: `Temp: 23.45 C`.
