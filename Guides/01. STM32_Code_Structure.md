## A. The STM32 equivalent of setup() and loop() functions found in Arduine IDE

| Arduino   | STM32 (CubeMX/HAL)                                                                               | Notes                         |
| --------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ----------------------------- |
| `setup()` | Code between `/* USER CODE BEGIN 2 */` and `/* USER CODE END 2 */` comments inside `main.c` file | Initialization code goes here |
| `loop()`  | Code between `/* USER CODE BEGIN 3 */` and `/* USER CODE END 2 */` comments inside `main.c` file | Put your repetitive code here |

Example in `main.c`:
```c
int main(void)
{  /* USER CODE BEGIN 2 */     // ← Initialization code here (like Arduino's setup())
   /* USER CODE END 2 */

  while (1)
  {
    /* USER CODE BEGIN 3 */   // ← Repeating code here (like Arduino's loop())
    /* USER CODE END 3 */
  }
}
```
> ℹ️ **Important**: Write your own code ONLY inside sections marked with comments like `/* USER CODE BEGIN x */` and `/* USER CODE END x */`.
These regions are preserved when you regenerate code with STM32CubeMX.
Anything outside these blocks may be deleted or overwritten.





## B. Global Variables - Declaration, definition and inclusion in the main source code

### Global variables should be declared in a `globals.h` file following these steps:
- navigate to "Project Explorer / YourProject / Core / Inc";
- right-click on "Inc" folder;
- choose "New / Header file";
- in the "New Header File" dialog window write "globals.h" in the "Header file:" field and choose "Default C header template" in "Template" field. Click "Finish".
- `globals.h` file opens automatically with some predefined code in it. Place your global variables just before the `endif /* GLOBALS_H_ */` line.
- include also the stdbool.h and stdint.h libraries (to make the code able to use boolean and int type variables).

> Examples of supported variables: `int`, `char`, `float`, `bool`, `uint8_t`, `int16_t`

Example of how the content of `globals.h` content should look like:
```c
/* === globals.h === */
#ifndef GLOBALS_H_
#define GLOBALS_H_
#include <stdbool.h>
#include <stdint.h>

extern int globalVariableName1;  // Declaration of a 1st variable
extern int globalVariableName2;  // Declaration of a 2nd variable
extern int globalVariableName3;  // Declaration of a 3rd variable

#endif /* GLOBALS_H_ */
```
### The global variables you declared in `globals.h` must be also defined (assigned default values) into a `globals.c` file following these steps:
- navigate to "Project Explorer / YourProject / Core / Src";
- right-click on "Src" folder;
- choose "New / Source file";
- in the "New Source File" dialog window write "globals.c" in the "Source file:" field and choose "Default C header template" in "Template" field. Click "Finish".
- `globals.c` file opens automatically. Add the '#include "global_variables.h"' line and set the type and the default value of each of your global variables.

Example of how the content of `globals.c` content should look like:
```c
/* === globals.c === */
#include "global_variables.h"
int globalVariableName1 = 0;  // Definition of the 1st variable
int globalVariableName2 = 0;  // Definition of the 2nd variable
int globalVariableName3 = 0;  // Definition of the 3rd variable
```


### To make your global variables available to the main code, the `globals.h` file must be included into `main.c` file following these steps:
- navigate to "Project Explorer / YourProject / Core / Src" and open the `main.c` file;
- search for the `'Private includes'` section and include your `globals.h` file as shown in the example below.
```c
/* === main.c === */

/* Private includes ----------------------------------------------------------*/
/* USER CODE BEGIN Includes */
#include "globals.h"
/* USER CODE END Includes */
```


### To make your global variables available to other source code files, the `globals.h` file must be included into that souce code file following these steps:
```c
/* === OtherThanGlobals.c === */
#include "globals.h"
int localVariableName = globalVariableName;
```

> ⚠️ A global variable must always be defines only once, in the `globals.c` file. Otherwise you will get a compilation error.
